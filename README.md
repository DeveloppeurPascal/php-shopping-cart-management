# PHP Shopping Cart Management

A simple to use and setup shopping cart management for websites with no database and Paybox, Paypal or ATOS SIPS payment system.

It's an old project (last updated in 2010) and it is not maintained anymore but you can look at it if you want to use an independant shopping cart on a PHP web sites.

This cart script is not usable for selling digital items in Europe (because it doesn't manage different tax level depending on customer country like needed by European laws).

The payment methods (Paybox, ATOS SIPS and Paypal) has evolved since last release of the script. You'll have to upgrade those parts or add an other payment system but the cart in itself must work well with just little changes (PHP upgrade) and setup (tax, country and other parameters).

We probably won't update the project because we don't use it anymore on our websites, but if you want to share your updates we will process PULL REQUESTS and check [issues](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/php-shopping-cart-management/issues).
